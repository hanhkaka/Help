1. Open a command prompt but do so with administrative privileges. See this link on how to do this.

2. If you are running Windows Vista 32-bit, then ensure the command prompt is currently in the directory “C:\Windows\System32\” which should be the default starting location when you open the command prompt. If you are running Vista 64-bit, then run the following command to get to the correct directory:

cd ..\SysWow64

3. Type the following command in the command prompt window and then press ENTER:

regsvr32 jscript.dll

    If the problem persists, then additionally run the command :

regsvr32 vbscript.dll

4. Try running the CS3 installer again. It should now work.
